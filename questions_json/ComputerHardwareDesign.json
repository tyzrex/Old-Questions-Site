                "2. What are different pipelining hazards? Highlight on the techniques that can be implemented to reduce these hazards. (5+5)",
                "3. Explain different associative structures for an eight-block cache. Assuming a cache of 4K blocks, a 4-word block size, and a 32bit address, find the total number of sets and the total number of tag bits for caches that are direct mapped, two-way and four-way set associative, and fully associative. (5+5)",
                "4. A program runs in 20 seconds on computer A, which has a 2 GHz clock. We are trying to help a computer designer build a computer, B, which will run this program in 12 seconds. The designer has determined that a substantial increase in the clock rate is possible, but thisincrease will affect the rest of the CPU design, causing computer B to require 1.4 times as many clock cycles as computer A for this program. What clock rate should the designer target? (5)",
                "5. Explain how TLB, virtual machine and cache can be integrated? (5)",

                "10. Suppose we have a benchmark that executes in 150 seconds of elapsed time, of which 120seconds is CPU time and the rest is I/O time. Suppose the number of processors doublesevery two years, but the processors remain the same speed, and I/O time doesn\u2019t improve.Calculate the improvement in CPU performance.
